# Nut programming language

## Introduction

Nut is a programming language is based on the book 
[crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom. My implementation is written in python but will be ported to zig after finishing the bytecode vm.

## Reqirements

No libraries are required but the interpreter only runs on python 3.9+.

### Usage
`python3 src/nut.py <file>`

eg
`python3 src/nut.py src/test.nut`
